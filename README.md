# Portfolio from Langyi Tian
With experiences in data science, social research, and marketing research, I have been dedicated to generate insights from large-scale business, social and administrative data. Here I have stored the outcome of 4 substantial projects, coming from either the real business problem-solving with internships, or acedemic researches that have resulted in conference presentation and publications.

To see my codings and machine learning practices, please visit #1 (R) and #2 (Python); to see my qualitative market research output, go to #3; To see my quantitative research capacity, please refer to #4 (presentation) and #5 (research paper). Below follows their brief introduction.

I appreciate your time to visit and take a look at my portfolios. All sorts of feedback are more than welcome!

  #1. Estimate 3 million properties in South Florida with machine learning algorithms (First Street Foundation, R)

This project builds from scratch machine learning algorithms that estimates property value in a large-scale dataset of 3 million properties in Florida. The outcomes add to the data science team’s work that presents the economic risk of tidal flooding.

  #2. Predicting missing income data in social surveys: a random forest approach (Poster presentation, Python)

I worked this project out with Weifan Xu from UC Berkley. We predicted missing values in a social survey (CFPS) to improve data quality by random forest model with 81.70% accuracy. The outcome has been made to a research poster presented at the UC Berkley.


  #3. Bring yerba mate to Chinese customers (Porteñas, focus groups)

I helped Porteñas, a bar startup in Williamsburg, explore solutions for their yerba mate drink to enter Chinese market. Conducting several focus groups and interviews, as well as quantitative sequantial monadic testing, I formulated recommendations on marketing mix to hit young white collars and students and the final research report is presented.


  #4. Consumer segments in urban China: insights from unsupervised learning (Social Forces, Stata)

This is a earlier work where I constructed 3-wave panel consumers data from a relational social survey database to portrait market fluctuations in 2012-16. From the data I generalized 3 market segments with different consumption patterns by Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Here the conference presentation is attached.


  #5. Consumer behavior of elderly leisure in urban China (Journal of Consumer Culture, Stata)

I conducted ethnographic observation with an elder couple and modeled consumption determinants by robust regression in R to estimate “grey market” potential. The submitted research paper is attached.
